Online ArUco marker sheet generator
====

Generate multiple ArUco markers online and print or save them to PDF with ease. Forked from the excellent Online ArUco Markers Generator ([arucogen](https://github.com/okalachev/arucogen)) by [Oleg Kalachev](http://chev.me).
Then re-forked from fodi's ([arucosheetgen](https://github.com/fodi/arucosheetgen)) by [Bence Fodor](https://github.com/fodi).
Thank you Oleg Kalachev and Bence Fodor!
I can also create a PR for your repo if you wish.
